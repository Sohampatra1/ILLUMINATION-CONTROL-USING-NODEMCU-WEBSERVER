# ILLUMINATION-CONTROL-USING-NODEMCU-WEBSERVER
Our Mini-Project aims at building an ESP8266 NodeMCU Web Server with a slider to perform various operations (Illumination Control) on a LED Lamp thereby replacing the common method and making the process way more user friendly than what it used to be and more appropriately making the entire process wireless.
